# Specification Quality Checklist: Student Capacity Display & Near-Capacity Upgrade Alert

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-04-13
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.
- FR-009 explicitly confirms no new backend endpoint is needed — the existing `GET /api/subscription/current` already provides all required data fields (`studentCount`, `isOverLimit`, `isExpired`).
- The near-capacity threshold (75% used / ≤25% remaining) is hardcoded per assumptions; if the team wants it configurable, that should be raised before planning.
